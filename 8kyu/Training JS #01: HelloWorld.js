mission 1:

use keyword function to define your function, function name should be helloWorld(don't forget the () and {})

mission 2:

use keyword var (or let or const) to define a variable str, value of str should be a string: "Hello World!"(don't forget the =).

// MY SOLUTION:

function helloWorld() {
    let str = "Hello World!"
    console.log(str)
}


// OTHER SOLUTIONS:

const helloWorld = () => {
  var str = `Hello World!`;
  console.log(str);
};

// Another one:



const helloWorld = => {let str = 0; console.log('Hello World!')}
